## Background on the Automatidata scenario
Automatidata works with its clients to transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions, such as performance dashboards, customer-facing tools, strategic business insights, and more. They specialize in identifying a client’s business needs and utilizing their data to meet those business needs. 

Automatidata is consulting for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). New York City TLC is an agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles. The agency has partnered with Automatidata to develop a regression model that helps estimate taxi fares before the ride, based on data that TLC has gathered. 

The TLC data comes from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees, making approximately one million combined trips per day. 

- Note: This project's dataset was created for pedagogical purposes and may not be indicative of New York City taxi cab riders' behavior.

## Data dictionary
This project uses a dataset called 2017_Yellow_Taxi_Trip_Data.csv. It data gathered by the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission and published by the city of New York as part of their NYC Open Data program. In order to improve the learning experience and shorten runtimes, a sample was drawn from the 113 million rows in the 2017 Yellow Taxi Trip Data table.


## Project background
Automatidata is in the earliest stages of the TLC project. The following tasks are needed before the team can begin the data analysis process:

- Build a dataframe for the TLC dataset

- Examine data type of each column

- Gather descriptive statistics


## Specific project deliverables
With this end-of-course project, you will gain valuable practice and apply your new skills as you complete the following:

- Complete the questions in the Course 2 PACE strategy document

- Answer the questions in the Jupyter notebook project file

- Complete coding prep work on project’s Jupyter notebook

- Summarize the column Dtypes

- Communicate important findings to DeShawn and Luana in the form of an executive summary
